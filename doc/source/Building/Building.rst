Building
********
The project files are already prepared and include everything except the 
required dependencies. This document lists both dependencies as well as the 
build process to create the library from source.

Supported Platforms
-------------------
The currently supported platforms for libmrhvt are the same as the ones listed 
for all MRH platform projects: Debian-based Linux and macOS. 

The main targets for this library are Debian-based Linux distributions.

Dependencies
------------
This library has the following dependencies:

* mrhshared
* libmrhbf

Build Tools
-----------
This release includes a CMake script (CMakeLists.txt) for a simplified build 
process. The minimal required version for CMake is 3.1.
Also needed is the GNU C++ Compiler. Full C++14 support is required.

Changing Pre-defined Settings
-----------------------------
The space reserve step for the event storage is handled by using preprocessor 
macros. These are listed in the CMakeLists.txt file and can easily be changed 
there to fit the requirements of the target use case.

Build Process
-------------
The build process should be relatively straightforward:

1. Aqquire dependencies.
2. Compile Makefiles with the included CMakeLists.txt
3. Move to the "build" folder and run make. This creates both static and 
   shared libraries.
4. Install the compiled library and its header files.
