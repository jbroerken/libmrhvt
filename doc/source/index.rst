libmrhvt is an open source library which includes multiple tools for working 
with voice / string user input and output. It supports trigger files to match 
user input to action, semi-random sentence building with sentence files, 
conversation logging and more.

This documentation includes listings for the internal functions, enumerations, 
etc. used by the library itself. These are not meant to be used directly for 
application development but as information for library development.

As such, this documentation is both aimed at developers wanting to write their 
own user applications as well as library developers wishing to improve on the 
libmrhvt source.
