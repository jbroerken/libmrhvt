The libmrhvt library implements the files and functions used for voice and text 
based interactions. It provides the management for input triggers, output 
generators and clean list files. Also included are string comparison and string 
manipulation functions to build, manage and prepare input and output strings 
based on events.

This documentation includes listings for the internal functions, enumerations, 
etc. used by the library itself. These are not meant to be used directly for 
application development but as information for library development.

As such, this documentation is both aimed at developers wanting to write their 
own user applications as well as library developers wishing to improve on the 
libmrhvt source.
